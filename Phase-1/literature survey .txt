\b OBJECTIVE OF THE PROJECT:\b0\par
In this busy world parents have no much time to take care of their babies and women\par
have no much time to take care about themselves so, the world is moving towards smart\par
technology through internet of things. In our project we are implementing and developing\par
adults and child security using IoT [6]. Here, we mainly concentrate on temperature,\par
heartbeat, crying, alerting guardians through smart phone using IoT with the help of\par
raspberry Pi. All IoT sensors have analogue ports and they give output as Analog. In order\par
to interface analog values to raspberry Pi Analog to Digital conversion is used. Analog to\par
Digital is a modulation and demodulation process. The different sensors used are\par
Temperature sensor, Heartbeat sensor, Accelerometer and sound sensor. Temperature\par
sensor give values in terms of voltage to IC as 0.35 etc. Heartbeat sensor gives values in\par
terms of pulse PIC microcontroller act as a counter to count Heartbeat rate. Sound sensor\par
gives analog values. Some threshold is set whenever the external value crosses the\par
threshold. It will detect as child/ women is crying. Accelerometer detects position\par
depending on the coordinates. It gives result in form of X, Y and Z values. All these values\par
from various sensors are analog values, they cannot be interfaced directly with Raspberry\par
pi. So, Analog to Digital microcontroller is used i.e. PIC 16F877A that converts analogue\par
values to digital form. All these values from various sensors are sent to PIC microcontroller\par
that does all A-D conversions. Finally, the converted values/information are sent by serial\par
communication by single wire to Raspberry pi3. Raspberry pi3 collects all data from PIC\par
controller and upload it to server. Server used is thing speak cloud. That could be used to\par
monitor health and safety of child/women. The device has two modes. Child mode and\par
women mode. One can easily set the mode to 0 or 1. 0 is child mode and 1 is women\par
mode. The system has lithium ion battery which is used for power supply with minimum\par
discharge rate. It also has pi camera that is used to capture image of the people in front\par
or the situation. There is an emergency switch which can be pressed manually either by\par
child or women. When an emergency switch is pressed buzzer is activated which is used\par
to alert nearby people so that they can come to the child/women rescue. Depending on\par
the conditions set parents/guardian are notified via SMS and e-mail. SMS through Twilio\par
could be sent along with details of temperature. Heartbeat rate and position of the ward.\par
Email is also sent simultaneously along with the images and other data. Location is also\par
sent in both SMS and e-mail with longitude and latitude values to parent/guardian.\par

\b 2. RFID based System for School Children Transportation Safety Enhancement\b0\par

OBJECTIVE OF THE PROJECT:\par
\b A\b0 . RFID based System for School Children Transportation Safety Enhancement\par
In this paper author had presented a device to monitor pick-up and drop-off of kid to\par
enhance the well-being during daily transportation from school and to school. In this\par
system there are two main units, abus unit, and a school unit. The bus unit is the system\par
which is used to determine when a child is boarding or leaving the bus. The information\par
from bus unit is then sent to the school system that identifies the students that haven\rquote t\par
board or leave the bus. It then issues an alert message. In this paper author has a\par
developed a web-based and database-driven application for controlling of the device. This\par
application provides beneficial details about the children to caregiver\rquote s personnel.\par
\b B\b0 . Smart IoT Device for Child Safety and Tracking\par
It provides guardians with the real-time tracking of location, UV radiation index,\par
surrounding temperature, and SOS light with a Distress alarm buzzer for their kids to make\par
people near child to know that child is in panic. It provides feature to locate their kid or\par
alert bystanders so that they can act to comfort the child or rescue the child. In this device\par
they have used Thing Speak, Micro Electro Mechanical Systems (MEMS), Node MCU, GPS,\par
GSM and Various sensors. This device gives the result for the parent in two different ways.\par
The first one is they get an alert message (SMS) for the registered phone number. The\par
next one is they receive a graphical representation which shows the Latitude, Longitude,\par
MEMS Sensor and Vibration sensor of the child\rquote s activities through \ldblquote Thing Speak\rdblquote . The\par
disadvantage of this device that to use this device there must be efficient flow of internet\par
connection and it must be fullest. Then only it gives the outputs at the earliest otherwise\par
it takes time for the result.\par
\b C\b0 . Child Safety Wearable Device\par
This project focuses communication mode to be in SMS text form using GSM. The parent\par
will send a key word in form of SMS \ldblquote SOS\rdblquote , \ldblquote BUZZ\rdblquote , \ldblquote LOCATION\rdblquote , \ldblquote TEMPERATURE\rdblquote  etc.,\par
to the devices. The device will reply back the real time accurate location of the child and\par
will also provide the surrounding temperature, or any of the data asked by the parents. It\par
helps parents to keep track if the temperature around their kid is not proper for their kid.\par
The secondary idea implemented was distress alarm buzzer and a bright SOS Light on the\par
device that can be activated by the guardians via sending the keywords in the SMS.\par
Parents can text the keywords to ON the SOS signal brightly and can also send the keyword\par
to sound an alarm which a people near child or bystander can instantly help the child's till\par
the parents arrive. People around could also contact the parents and help them to reunite\par
child with his or her parents. Hence this project provides parents a sense of protection for\par
their kid in today's unsafe environment. The drawback of this system is that parent have\par
to remember the keywords.\par
\b D\b0 . A Smart Security for Child Safety\par
Child tracking is mainly based on two units GPS watch and Android monitoring unit. This\par
wearable device unit consist of a GPS receiver, Flexi Force Sensor, Temperature Sensor\par
and MEMS accelerometer. This security Wearable Device will keep the child safe. The\par
parent will get the continuous update about their child temperature and various other\par
factors, so that they not afraid about their child well-being when they are not with their\par
kid. This would create some fear in the persons mind who are involved in child trafficking\par
and harassment. As a well-known proverb \ldblquote Prevention is better than cure\rdblquote , this\par
application will act as a prevention for the child safety from harassment and kidnapping.\par

\b OBJECTIVE OF THE PROJECT:\b0\par
The basic operation of the proposed child tracking system is that when a violation of child\par
safe is detected, a specific sensor in child module will produce a signal. This signal will be\par
sent from these sensors and GPS to microcontroller then through transmitter to parent\par
module. The parent module will take the decision and start the violation handling\par
procedure. the operation of the child tracking system requires certain hardware between\par
child model and parent one. This includes a certain driving circuit that activates the\par
sensors. The main hardware parts of child tracking system are; sensor driving circuits, GPS,\par
PIC, Transceiver, Buzzer, LCD and Keypad. Hiroshima City Children Tracking System is a\par
safety support system for children based on ad hoc network technologies. Field\par
experiments have been conducted in cooperation with an elementary school in\par
Hiroshima. In this paper, we propose a new generation children. Tracking system which is\par
based on experiences and findings of the field experiments for Hiroshima City Children\par
Tracking System. Our proposed system consists of Android terminals which has Wireless\par
LAN device and Bluetooth device with the ad hoc communication function. Our system\par
manages groups of Android terminals using Autonomous Clustering technique. Challenges\par
with gathering data techniques using mobile and unexpected environment (mobile\par
context), as well as, the privacy issues on gathering personal information from a third\par
party applications.\par
